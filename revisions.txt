"scanDirectory" deprecated. Put in a working routine.

- put in changes documented in forum around February 2016, mainly changing the "Eingabe" part of the script to correctly display single items.
- venue list was improperly displayed in frontend input of a single date (input AND select were displayed). Corrected.

results_success.tpl: Demo template expanded, new feature: month name proceeds every bundle of items for that month.

2016-06-13
Module output: if module was used multiple times, class "sKalender" was loaded multiple times => error. Class call is checked now before it is executed.

2016-08-11
Module "Ausgabe" output section: if module was used multiple times, $terminliste wasn't empty the second time in case no dates should have been found there. Added/moved array initiations for $MOD and $terminliste.
Module "Ausgabe" output section: the variables for short and full year determination had reversed y/Y flags. Fixed.
Module "Ausgabe" and "Eingabe", input section: if-conditions for includes, to avoid collision with other TONE2TONE modules e.g. ALR where same name files are included.

2016-11-28
Template "results_success.tpl" treated "target" with true or false instead of blank or empty content. Corrected. 

2016-11-30
Function "Link setzen" only showed external links in result-template, no internal or file links. Corrected in module output and in template file.

2018-12-13 Module "Ausgabe" output section, line 432: $tlimage->loadByPrimaryKey() is a double function as one line above the instance is already called. Deleted.

2019-04-24
Updated Terminliste-Ausgabe with all additions from contenido-forum from 2016 to 2018.
Updates results-success Smarty template to show more possibilities related to date and time.
Bug: hardcoded "http" prohibited saving dates on a https site. Code changed to generic protocol variable to make it flexible for each setting.
